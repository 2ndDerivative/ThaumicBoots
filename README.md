# Thaumic Boots
Thaumic Boots is a new addon for thaumcraft 4 (yes I know I'm about 9 years late to the party)
   
This mod will be almost entirely focused on adding new boots and combinations of already existing boots Thaumcraft

I'd also like to take this line to extend my thanks to the Arcana team for their lovely textures and just amazing mod in general, I'll be spending a lot
of time backporting a lot of their content, so thank you Arcana Dev Team for allowing the use of Arcana assets except the lore!
Specificially thank you to Ibanplay for the lovely textures! Thank you for the good work sir!
